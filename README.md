# Challenges and Learnings
- Getting Started: When starting this I had a lot of trouble starting and getting off the ground. In school, I would be given requirements and a direction on where to start this made it easy to start building the project, however in this project I only had an idea and a vision of where I want this personal project to be I would stare blank at the code editor and wonder where to start. To overcome this challenge I started by working on parts that im interested in how they would work and work on that, I would build one small part and while working on that one part I would get ideas for other parts. This would result me into a rhythm where ideas would come one after another
- Consistency: This was something I struggled with throughout, being able to work on this without an extended time of not working on it. I was able to move past this by organizing my time easier, using project management tools using onenot to set up my notes and my duties for a day so I can set aside set time to work and focus. This will be something I continue to further improva and get better at.
